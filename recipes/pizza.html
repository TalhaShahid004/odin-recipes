    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat <strong>base</strong> of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>
